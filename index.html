              <p>This app was my capstone project for the <a href="http://www.bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc.io</a> full stack developers bootcamp. Upload images from your computer or via a link and create an online vision board to help a user visualize their dreams.</p>
              <p>The project took about three weeks, originally the project incorporated a third party website to find select images in real time, however due to cross domain security issues, that idea had to be nixed. The new solution involved pulling random images from the community to use instead.</p>

              <p>Originally this site was created using PHP.  After it was completed the company had an internal department re-configure the site to work with the Orchid CMS.  A year later they came back and asked to have the site converted into a Wordpress site.</p>
              <p>While converting the site for Wordpress, I incorporated the Yoast SEO plugin and modified pages metadata and content to better optimize the site for SEO.  After a month the test server site was indexing in the top 20 on Google.</p>

              <p>This was my first major introduction to the power of PHP. Armed with Google, StackOverflow, and a lot of trial and error, I was able to create a major business to business portal for international bank branches.</p>
              <p>The site allowed securely logged in users to create support tickets by uploading multiple images directly from their desktops.</p>
              <p>The admin portal allowed admins to check logs, send site messages to all or individual users, and see site traffic and specific user interactions.</p>
